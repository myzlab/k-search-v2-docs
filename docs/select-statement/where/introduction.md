# Introduction

The `WHERE` clause uses `KCondition` to filter the rows returned from the `SELECT` clause. (To learn more about the conditions, please go to the [`KCondition`](/docs/kcondition/introduction) section).

To fully study the `WHERE` clause, visit its documentation [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-WHERE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-WHERE)
