The HAVING clause uses [`KCondition`](/docs/kcondition/introduction) to allows you to filter groups of rows according to a specified condition.

To fully study the `HAVING` clause, visit its documentation [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUP](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUP)
