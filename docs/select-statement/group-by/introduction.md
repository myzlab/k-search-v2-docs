The `GROUP BY` clause divides the rows returned from the `SELECT` statement into groups. For each group, you can apply an aggregate function. To see the full list of available aggregation functions, please visit the [`Aggregate Functions`](/docs/sql-functions/aggregate-functions/introduction) section. Methods for generate multiple [`GROUPING SETS`](/docs/select-statement/group-by/grouping-sets/introduction) in a query are also available.

To fully study the `GROUP BY` clause, visit its documentation [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUP](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUP)
