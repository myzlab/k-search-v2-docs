import K from '@site/src/components/K';

The `WHERE` clause uses [`KCondition`](/docs/kcondition/introduction) to filter the rows to delete from the `DELETE FROM` clause.

To fully study the `WHERE` clause, visit its documentation [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-WHERE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-WHERE)
